## Moviepy ElectronGUI App

Going to try my hand at creating a moviepy web app wrapper. 
Update: Lets make it an Electron Desktop App, that way I'm building a webapp and a desktop client.
Will be looking around for examples and probably apply info to this readme as I go.
I'm still condering myself a script Kiddie, with asperations of being a real coder.
Hoping this changes that.
